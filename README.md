A demonstration of applying a genetic algorithm to the problem of monkeys writing Shakespeare.

# Random Demo
Run the Random class to generate 100,000,000 samples of completely random attempts to write "TO BE
OR NOT TO BE". (Spoiler alert: It doesn't go well.)

# Genetic Algorithm Demo
Run the GeneticAlgorithm class to generate a much longer sequence using a genetic algorithm.
